# Postfix-Machine-Language-Instructions

The purpose of this project was to build a Stack data structure and use it to 
print out machine language instructions. The PostFixInstructions takes a postfix 
expression and prints the instructions on how to convert to an infix expression.

Only aplhabetical characters in the expression are to be stored in the stack until
the program encounters an operator or the sequence is complete.
